Installation and RUN

This program will find the amount of time it takes to send a message between two astronauts in space using satellites.
The user will be prompted for the coordinates of each astronaut, how many satellites there are, and the coordinates of each satellite.
Note that the speed of light is used in the programs calculations, which is assumed to be 299,792,458 m/s
